The mobile app written by ReactNative that allows user to swipe write to find best matched restaurant based on their submited needs.

# Inspiration
There are too many great places to eat when you visit a major city. This is great but you will suffer from the paradox of choice, for example, have you ever spent an hour just browsing Google Maps on which of the thousands of restaurants to eat next? This recommendation app intends to fix that problem by  picking the best restaurant with only a single click based on the least amount of questions it can

# How we built it
We design the UI in Figma, then implementing in ReactNative. The recommendation engine is based on the responses from google place API conresponding to information of users query. We also use FireStore in Firebase as a Database Mangagement System. The google cloud platform provides us API key to use in googe place.

We had to to some new tools includin ReactNative, Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, Google Place API. Therefore we face some trouble regarding authentication when fetching API.
